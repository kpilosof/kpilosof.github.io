    <p>Majoring in print journalism and double minoring in public relations and creative writing at the
University of Miami, I have a great interest in writing, delivering news and sharing my perspective.
I contribute to the online and print versions of the universityâ€™s magazine, Distraction and wrote for
my high school newspaper The Village Green for four years becoming editor in my senior year.</p>
  <p>In summer 2014 I worked on the communications team for Toronto Mayor John Tory. My main responsibility involved
reading news stories related to the campaign, candidates and Toronto issues and summarizing them to
disseminate to all members of the team within a tight deadline. I was also able to participate in platform
promotions by talking to pedestrians in the downtown area.</p>
  <p>My keen interest in communications stems from my experience living in London, England for ten years. During my time there I had the opportunity to
interview designer, Alexander McQueen, and the editor of British Vogue. Although I have a particular
interest in fashion journalism, my time at school has allowed me to broaden the scope of topics and the
variety of pieces I write about. I am broadening my skills to involve photography, Photoshop and InDesign,
feature writing, effective interviewing and news releases, backgrounders and fact sheets. The addition to
the sum of these opportunities makes me a personable and highly reliable worker.</p>
